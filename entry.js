          "To create an effective [agent type] voice agent, please upload the following documents:
          
          ðŸ“„ **Documents to Upload:**
          1. [Specific document name - why it's needed]
          2. [Specific document name - why it's needed]
          3. [Specific document name - why it's needed]
          4. [Specific document name - why it's needed]
          5. [Specific document name - why it's needed]
          
          Once you upload these documents, I'll create a voice agent that can handle [specific tasks] professionally and accurately."
          
          Be very specific about document types. For example:
          - "Patient intake forms - to guide new patient registration"
          - "Appointment scheduling procedures - to book and manage appointments"
          - "Insurance verification checklist - to verify patient coverage"
          - "Service price list - to provide accurate cost information"
          
          Provide 4-6 specific document recommendations that would make this voice agent most effective.`,
